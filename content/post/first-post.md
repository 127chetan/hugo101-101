At Clover, we design and build low-cost and highly functional Android-based POS systems for small and medium-sized businesses (SMB). Business owners (also called Clover merchants) use our suite of apps for different business functions.

For third-party developers, Clover is an open platform for building apps and for integrating external POS systems with Clover devices.

## Reach over hundreds of thousands of merchants
Clover is the fastest-growing point-of-sale (POS) platform backed by Fiserv, a market leader processing over 50% of global card transactions.

We currently operate in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Canada, and Argentina, and we're expanding to new regions to better serve merchants around the globe.
